---Dependencies (all included in cu-cs-csci3753 package)---
fuse-utils
openssl
attr
attr-dev
libfuse-dev
libssl1.0.0 or libssl0.9.8
libssl-dev

Note: To use extended attributes (xattr) on EXT filesystems,
      you must add the 'user_xattr' mount option to the
      mount options of any mounts on which you intend to use 
      extended attributes. Failure to so may result in an error
      when trying to set, get, or remove xattr values.

---Folders---
rootdir - a directory with which to mirror
mountdir - an empty directory which rootdir mounts to

---Files---
Makefile         - GNU makefile to build all relevant code
README           - This file
pa4-encfs.c      - Implementation of a mirroring file system using FUSE conmbined with encryption funcitonality
                 - Assistance on xmp_read and xmp_write functions from Miles Rufat-Letre
aes-crypt.h      - Basic AES file encryption library interface
aes-crypt.c      - Basic AES file encryption library implementation

---Executables---
pa4-encfs        - a mounting file system, utilizes FUSE and encryption

---Examples---

***Building***

Build All:
 make

Clean:
 make clean

***FUSE Examples***

Mount a rootdirectory on new directory
 ./pa4-encfs <Password> <Root Point> <Mount Point>
 ./fusehello <Mount Point>

Unmount a FUSE filesystem
 fusermount -u <Mount Point>

Running pa4-encfs
Creating a file in <Mount Point> - touch <FILE NAME>
Editing a file in <Mount Point> - echo > <FILE NAME> <text>

please note that gedit and other text editors have a different interface than what this
implementation of FUSE was written to support and do not work, can only edit files in 
<Mount Point> with echo.
